# Simple Server
Personal project as a way to understand how client-server apps work.

## Structure
### Branches
`master` branch holds the latest stable build that is advised to use. Other branches contan brand new untested features or new technologes that I am going to implement soon or outdated technologes for use and observe as evolution of project.

### Code structure
Folder `server` holds everithing for the server run and `client` contains client code.

## Future tasks
- [x] Initial base server-client like architecture.
- [ ] Multi-threading connections handling.
